I just added Jekyll to create a blog for my webpage. I need to get a theme for it but this is a start for now. Here is the content that was on it before...

Old content:

* [Click here to play 1 to NxN][nxnlink]
* [Here is my cookie clicker hack (old, probably broken)][cclink]
* [Snake!][snakelink]

[nxnlink]: /1toNxN.html
[cclink]: /cookie.html
[snakelink]: /snake/
