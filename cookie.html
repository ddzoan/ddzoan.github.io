	How to use:<ol>
		<li>Bookmark this link <a href="javascript: (function(){var inject = document.createElement('script');inject.setAttribute('src','http://ddzoan.github.io/cookieclicker.js?'+Date.now());document.body.appendChild(inject);})()">Cookie Clicker Hack</a>. You can do this by dragging the link to your bookmark bar</li>
		<li>go to <a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker game</a> and when it loads, click the bookmark</li>
		<li>there will be buttons at the top of the screen which turn on/off certain functionality</li>
	</ol>
<br><br><br>Some notes:
<ul>
	<li>some accessible variables<ul>
		<li>pricePerCpS - Price divided by the Cookies per Second (CpS) rate of production for that building</li>
		<li>sortedValueBuys - Array of buildings sorted by from lowest to highest price per CpS</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>the auto shopper only works if you have at least one of each item purchased</li>
	<li>the auto clicker clicks the cookie as fast as it can. it also clicks golden cookies which give you bonuses and cookie production multipliers</li>
	<li>the circle clicker is to click the wrinklers during the grandmapocaplyse. it just clicks around the edges of the circle where the wrinklers are. the tab must be in focus for it to work or else the wrinklers will not get clicked.</li>
	<li>the seasonal clicker clicks things like reindeer</li>
	<li>the golden cookie clicker will click the golden cookie only. this is useful if you are trying to get the neverclick achievement</li>
</ul>
